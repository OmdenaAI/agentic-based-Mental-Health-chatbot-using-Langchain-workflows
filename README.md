# 🧠 OmdenaBot: Agentic Mental Health Chatbot

🚀 **About the Project**
This repository hosts the OmdenaBot, an AI-powered mental health chatbot developed using the CrewAI framework, FastAPI, and Meta Cloud Platform (MCP). Designed to support both users and therapists, this system aims to offer real-time feedback, emotional analysis, and potential future predictions.

🔗 **Omdena Challenge Page**
📌 Challenge Title: [Building Agentic-based Mental Health Chatbot using Langchain Workflows](https://www.omdena.com/chapter-challenges/building-agentic-based-mental-health-chatbot-using-langchain-workflows)

🎯 **Objectives**
- Provide personalized feedback and mental health tips.

- Use LLM agents for emotionally adaptive responses with grounded knowledge folder containing necessery docs from data collection.

- Build RAG-based retrieval, multi-agent flow, and real-time insights.

- Enable dashboard tracking - **under construction**
  
- Enable crisis alerts, and integration with third-party (authorized by user) support, for the benefite of both user and his therapist, via Meta's MCP connection to Whatsup API. - **under construction**
  
- Enable profile feedback scoring (GAD) - **under construction**
  
- Enable excercises by extracting bot's response into an interactive activity. - For example: If it's a kid, then it might be a link to a game or meditation excercise according to bot's response (trigger words) - **under construction**
  
- Enable dashboard monthly report download or sent via whatsup for user/therapist, maybe even for research (The user cosents his details and conversations are being recorded) - **under construction**
  
- Further implementations can be : User feedback (like/didn't like the bot's response) , logs folder saves csv's for later analysis and predictions on users profiles according to their inputs. Also making the app a multi user app for all family or for a therapist list of patients. **under construction**

- source venv/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4.  **Set up .env:**
   
   * Rename the provided .env.template to .env
   * Add your actual API keys where indicated

5. **Create required folders:**
   ```
   mkdir logs
   ```

6. **Run the backend:**
   ```
   set PYTHONPATH=src && uvicorn mentalhealth_chatbot.app:app --reload
   ```

   🌐 # **Public Deployment via ngrok :**

   If you want others to access your app publicly:
   ```
   ngrok http 3000
   ```
Use the generated https://xyz.ngrok.io as your public URL.

⚠️ **This project's version is already deployed via:**
   ```
   https://ortal.ngrok.io
   ```
  FastAPI can be seen in this URL:
  ```
  https://ortal.ngrok.io/docs#/
  ```
Note: The ngrok URL's are working only when backend is connected and running on Visual Studio.

   🧠 # **CrewAI Agent System :**

   This app runs using CrewAI and LangChain, with multiple agents such as:
   * Knowledge Retriever
   * Knowledge Summarizer
   * Workflow Orchestrator

   All logic is defined inside src/agents.yaml, src/tasks.yaml, and crew.py.

  🖥️ **Offline Fallback - for 24/7 emotional support in case there's no internet**
    
  1. Install Ollama locally
    (a lightweight LLM server that runs on-device)
    
  2. Pull the model (e.g., LLaMA3)
    
    ```
    ollama pull llama3
    ```
    
  3. Run Ollama locally
    Ollama listens on http://localhost:11434 — your app connects to it as the LLM provider.
    
  4. Start the chatbot app locally
    The backend will detect the offline status and route prompts to LLaMA3.

  📝 # **Notes :**

    * The .env file must be configured correctly for the app to work.

    * Make sure uv.lock is renamed properly if needed.

    * Pushes to GitHub require that untracked files are added and committed properly.
